VIRUS
I would like to begin by noting that this project did not turn out at all like I wanted it to.
I originally had much bigger and passionate ideas for the plot, but I found myself out of time
due to extravagant plans over the winter break. I am quite disappointed with the final result and
the severe lack of content, but I do feel confident in that I have gained some skills during the
creation of this project.

The program revolves around a virus named Perl who appears on your computer. She appears to be
in need of help at first, gaining your sympathy and remorse through her kindness and helplessness.
However, putting trust in her ends up backfiring as, upon disabling the antivirus software, the 
perl.exe virus takes over, causing the computer to crash and blue screen. 
This interactive program was intended to invoke worry around internet safety and trust, particularly
when it comes to blindly following the instructions of someone untrustworthy. I personally would have 
liked to go much deeper with the story, but I found myself challenged by my lack of organization and 
time efficiency. If you play close attention, Perl says that she 'can't control it' and that she is sorry.
This was my last minute attempt to create some depth to her character, creating the perspective that
she may not intentionally be a malicious virus and instead simply wants to accompany you.
Of course, my program barely shows this and so I'm quite upset by this.

In terms of programming, I found it difficult implementing a lot of the computer features, such as 
working with real time which was incredibly confusing.


I had the most fun with the visuals for this, creating most of my assets using Photoshop and Procreate.
I was heavily inspired by Windows XP graphics, even using the background as a source and editing it in Photoshop.
The retro UI look almost adds to the eeriness and the fear around technology, particularly in a nostalgic
time where computers were relatively new and advancing. 
The icons and windows were all made in Photoshop, either hand-drawn or made using rectangles.
I also intentionally chose a screen resolution of 1280x720p to simulate those retro resolutions
from before 1920x1080 became the norm. I enjoyed recreating the blue screen of death that every
Windows user hates to see - I found it added to the technological fear in the end.

For sound design, I recorded all of the key sound effects using my boyfriend's keyboard, and I
recorded the click sound effect using my mouse. The dialogue sound effect was just a voice note 
of my friend's voice that I recorded in audacity.

I had fun with the character design and I would have loved to develop Perl more as a character.
I designed her sprites in Procreate, and I had fun playing with different filters.

There are many features I really wanted to implement, but couldn't figure out the technicalities,
such as draggable windows. I did attempt it at multiple points but kept having issues such as
the images getting stuck to the cursor despite the mouse not being pressed. 
I also spent a lot of time trying to create animations which, in retrospect, was a huge waste of
time that I could have spent on actual content. At one point I was so stuck and frustrated 
trying to program it so that a window would expand open in size similar to how they do in Windows,
but I could never get it to work.

Overall, I feel that I understand DOM elements a bit more, and the separation between DOM elements
and the visual elements that you see on the canvas.
